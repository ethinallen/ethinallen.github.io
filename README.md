## Who am I?
My name is Andrew Emery. I am a second semester Junior at Clemson University and am seeking employment with a company that is interested in growing alongside me as I develop my data science skillset.

## What am I doing?
I am currently conducting data science research for the Clemson Energy Visualization and Analytics Center. More specifically, I train machine-learning algorithms to develop utility consumption models for the entire campus. I mainly use Python and SAS Cloud Computing to accomplish these tasks.

## Projects
#### [Bitcoin Price Alert](https://github.com/ethinallen/btc)   
The goal of this project was to alert me when the amount of money earned from a given bitcoin investment dropped below 80% of the max earning value. I used [coinmarketcap's](https://api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/ticker/bitcoin/) to get the current bitcoin price (I chose to neglect the minor differences between marketplaces) and twilio's api to send a text alert to my phone when the program detected the price falling below the thresh-hold. Earnings: $30 (don't trade btc)

#### [Road Trip Planner](https://github.com/ethinallen/trip-planner)
This project is a flavor of Djikstra's Algorithm with weights. I used the Google Maps API to get the distance and driving time between points of interest. The algorithm uses how much participants want to go to a given location to determine which locations would not abide by the time constraint given. It then outputs which locations to visit and the order in which they should be visited.

#### [Essay Generator](https://github.com/ethinallen/Random-Summary-Generator)   
In IE3140, a seminar for Industrial Engineers at Clemson, we were tasked with writing 500 word summaries about the previous week's lecture. It became readily apparent that the TA had no intention of reading the submissions so, naturally, I wrote a script to write my essays. It was designed to construct sentences that were 13 words long (on average), correctly capitalized, and composed solely of random assortments of the top 1000 words used in the English language.

## My Story
I initially came to Clemson only interested in statistics, but at [CUhackit](https://cuhack.it) sophomore year my friends and I witnessed the birth of a new passion of mine: Python development   
The following year I would begin a multitude of personal projects. Most of them would fail. However: with every failure I gained more intimate knowledge of the Python programming language that only served me better when the next project came around. My interest in programming would land me my first internship at Bosch Rexroth Spring of 2019. There, I helped to install a [3D scanner](http://www.polyrix.com/) and develop plans for implementing the new system in parallel with the systems already in place at the plant. While, I still whip up terrible programs at breakneck speeds but my day job is working under [Tim Howard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-howard-5a39233/) and [Dr. David White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-white-8709258/) at the Watt Student Center. This summer's project revolved around training an algorithm (the team named him Jonathan) to predict the power consumption of the Watt Family Innovation center based on weather conditions. The goal for this fall is to transition the model to a LSTM model and then get Jonathan to predict the steam consumption of the campus.
