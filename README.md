## My Story
I initially came to Clemson only interested in statistics, but at [CUhackit](https://cuhack.it) sophomore year my friends and I witnessed the birth of a new passion of mine: Python development   
The following year I would begin a multitude of personal projects. Most of them would fail. However: with every failure I gained more intimate knowlege of the Python programming language that only served me better when the next project came around. My interest in programming would land me my first internship at Bosch Rexroth Spring of 2019. There, I helped to install a [3D scanner](https://polyrix.com) and develop plans for implementing the new system in parallel with the systems already in place at the plant. While, I still whip up terrible programs at breakneck speeds but my day job is working under [Tim Howard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-howard-5a39233/) and [Dr. David White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-white-8709258/) at the Watt Student Center. My team and I have worked very hard  this summer on developing our product and are proudly presenting on August 7, all are welcome!
